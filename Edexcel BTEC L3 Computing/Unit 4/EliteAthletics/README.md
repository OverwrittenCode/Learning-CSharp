# Request

A local elite athletics academy has commissioned you as a Junior Software Developer to write a program. The program should allow the coach to record race times for the 100 metre elite athletes and display them in order from fastest to slowest.

# Objective

You need to create a program that:

- Enables the coach to choose if the race involves male or female athletes.
- Allows the coach to enter finishing times for athletes in lane order.
- Displays finishing times in order from fastest time to slowest time, to two decimal places.
- Displays a message alerting the coach if a World, European, or British record has been achieved.

# Success Criteria

You must design, implement, and test your program. You must also justify and evaluate your decisions.

When you are designing and developing the solution, ensure that:

- Standard programming conventions have been followed.
- It is efficient and robust.
- A suitable data structure is used.
- Outputs are meaningful.
- It is easy to use.
- The program is tested using normal, abnormal, and extreme data.

# Information

You should use the information in Figure 1 when you are designing and developing your program:

| Men’s Record Times        | Women’s Record Times      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| World Record Time: 9.58    | World Record Time: 10.49  |
| European Record Time: 9.86 | European Record Time: 10.73|
| British Record Time: 9.87  | British Record Time: 10.99 |

| Minimum Number of Athletes | Maximum Number of Athletes |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| 4                          | 8                          |

*Note: record times correct as of September 2017.*
