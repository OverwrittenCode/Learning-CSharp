# Request

A local school has commissioned you as a Junior Software Developer to write a program.

The program should allow the teachers to record test results for students and display
them in order from highest to lowest.

# Objective

You need to create a program that:

- Enables the teacher to enter the number of students in the class
- Allows the teacher to enter student name and test result for all students
- Displays test results in order from highest mark to lowest mark along with the grade and student’s name
- Displays a message alerting the teacher if a distinction has been achieved
- Writes the test results to a text file.

# Success Criteria

You will design, implement, and test your program. You must also justify and evaluate your decisions.

When designing and developing the solution, ensure that:

- Standard programming conventions have been followed.
- It is efficient and robust.
- It is user-friendly
- it provides accurate grade calculations
- There is an output to show:
    - Test results in order from highest mark to the lowest mark along with the grade and student’s name
    - If a distinction has been achieved and by which student.
