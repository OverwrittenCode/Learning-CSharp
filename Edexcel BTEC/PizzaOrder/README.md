# Request

The owner of a local pizza restaurant has commissioned you as a Junior Software Developer to write a program that will help their staff calculate the cost of takeaway pizza orders.

# Objective

You need to create a program that will allow the staff to enter this information:

- Customer details:
    - Name
    - Address
    - Phone number
- The quantity of pizzas being ordered.
- The size of each pizza (an order can include different pizza sizes).
- An option to add more toppings to the standard pizzas if required.
- An option to request delivery.

The program should then provide the user with a personalised and itemised bill that shows:

- Customer details.
- The cost of each pizza, showing the standard cost of the pizza and any extra toppings.
- Any discount applied.
- Any delivery charge.
- The total cost of the order.

# Success Criteria

When designing and developing the solution, ensure that:

- Standard programming conventions have been followed.
- It is efficient and robust.
- A suitable data structure is used.
- Outputs are meaningful.
